Have cloud_pow.py create N ec2 instances
Have them run bash file that:
    - gets parallel_pow.py from S3
    - runs it with values determined by num of ec2s/its alpha position
Once steps_pow returns, put values on SQS queue
Which is picked up by cloud_pow.py and printed, then shutsdown everything

TODO:

Have s3 created programmatically 
Create own AMI
Create IAMs programmatically
